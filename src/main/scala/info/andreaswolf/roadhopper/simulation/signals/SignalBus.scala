/**
 * An implementation of the concept of "signals" as the output of components.
 *
 * Signals are declared by a component, other components can subscribe to them (= get notified when the signal changes).
 * With every new time step, an initial update is triggered with the components that listen to the time.
 *
 * The signal bus is invoked by the timer during each time step, and subsequently schedules one or more delta cycles,
 * depending on the behaviour of other components: If a signal is updated during a delta cycle, another delta cycle
 * is scheduled if there are any components listening to that signal. If no further delta cycle is scheduled, the time
 * step is finished and the future sent back to the timer is fulfilled, therefore letting it continue to the next time
 * step.
 *
 * Theoretically, we could create endless loops if there is a chain of signals where the first one depends on a change
 * of the last one. However, this is no real concern when modelling physical systems, as there are always delays due to
 * inertia etc., which let updates happen "far" in the future (as in "in a future timestep") and not "now" (as in "in
 * the next delta cycle").
 *
 * Signal values are not strongly typed, so you can basically write anything you like to them. However, when reading
 * back the value, you might need to apply typecasting, for which you will need to know the type.
 *
 * The time is the only signal pre-defined by the bus, and this is taken directly from the timer at the beginning of
 * each invocation. More signals can be defined by sending
 * [[info.andreaswolf.roadhopper.simulation.signals.SignalBus.DefineSignal]] messages; components can subscribe to
 * these signals with [[info.andreaswolf.roadhopper.simulation.signals.SignalBus.SubscribeToSignal]] messages.
