/**
 * Component that derives the target velocity from the road’s current allowed velocity.
 *
 * It does only observe a part of the road within the so-called lookahead distance. This concept and the formula for
 * calculating the distance were derived from [[http://oops.uni-oldenburg.de/1762/1/Lenk_Jan_156.pdf this paper]].
 *
 * This component currently features two different modes: free driving and stop sign. The default is "free driving",
 * where only the limit from the road is relevant for the target speed.
 * If a stop sign is encountered within the lookahead distance, the current mode switches to "stop sign", where the
 * target velocity is reduced to zero. After the vehicle has stopped and a short time has passed, the vehicle is
 * speeded up again.
